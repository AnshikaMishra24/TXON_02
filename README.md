Task:2 DESIGN A BANNER
TXON internship 2023
#design #internship
As a CSE student, I have gained valuable knowledge and experience in various aspects of technology and innovation. This banner serves as a visual representation of my skills, expertise, and passion for the field
I am excited to announce the launch of my first banner on LinkedIn!
this is task 02 given by TXON to me to do as it was my internship.
so today I am very happy to share this banner with you guys
This is the banner related to my previous post which was related to the clothing brand named La FafitZ so now this is the banner related to that brand only.
I invite you to take a moment to view my new LinkedIn banner. Feel free to share your thoughts, feedback, or any suggestions you may have. Additionally, if you have any upcoming projects or collaborations in the field of computer science, I would be thrilled to explore potential opportunities together.
